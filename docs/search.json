    "text": "A little about me\nHi everyone! My name is Katie Wells and I am a first year MPH student in the Epi concentration. I went to UGA for undergrad and majored in genetics; I also completed 2 years of undergraduate research in pertussis under Dr. Eric Harvill. I would love to study infectious disease epi and do more research in this field. I used R in undergrad in one course, and I just completed EPID 7500. I feel like there is always more to learn and understand in R no matter your skill level. I want to use this course to get more comfortable in programming and coding as I feel it is an integral part to almost every public health career. Something fun about me: I’ve had three hand surgeries in the past year all over a can of tomatoes (buy a decent can opener, everyone).\n\n\nHere’s a picture of me!\n\n\n\nIf you see me on campus say hey!\n\n\n\n\nSomething I find cool\nArtificial Intelligence for infectious disease Big Data Analytics - ScienceDirect\nI mentioned earlier that I am interested in infectious disease research; here’s an article I found about how AI can be used to increase accuracy in diagnosis, suggest treatments, and improve public health outcomes."

    "text": "This data was obtained from data.cdc.gov and contains data from 2/24/2022 to 1/26/2023. This dataset contains the same values used to display information available on the COVID Data Tracker, and is updated weekly. The CDC combines three metrics (new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days) to determine the COVID-19 community level and classify it as low, medium, or high. This community level can help people and communities make decisions based on their circumstances and individual needs. It has a total of 12 columns and 158,000 rows including all available county data.\nI decided to keep the “date_updated” variable as there will be multiple observations for each county.\nI decided I needed to reduce the number of observations to make this data a little easier to use; I decided to filter by Georgia to bring this number down as well as give me some relatable data.\nThis is still a lot of observations, so I decided to filter to approximately a six-month period (07-28-2022 - 01-26-2023)\nI think it would be interesting to use this data analyze the number of COVID cases per 100k in relation to bed utilization and hospital admissions, as well as the number of cases per 100k over time to observe trends in infection. I don;t know the best way to incorporate it, but a graph (boxplot maybe?) including the community leel would also be cool to see. These analyses could tell us something about COVID 19 case trends in Georgia during these last 6 months; as the pandemic draws on after almost 3 year it would be interesting to see what level of community severity still exists."

    "text": "This data comes from FiveThirtyEight’s article https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/college-fight-song-lyrics/. It contains stats on the fight songs of 65 schools – all those in the Power Five conferences (the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC), plus Notre Dame– including duration, beats per minute, and mentions of typical themes of a fight song. I am going to try to recreate the graph of fight song beats per minute versus duration. The original graph is below (with UGA selected); it is interactive, allowing users to select a university to see where they fall on the fight song bpm vs duration scale as well as how many “fight song cliches” it contains.\n\nHere I load all the packages I need to recreate this graph and load the data provided by FiveThirtyEight.\n\n#load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0     ✔ purrr   0.3.4\n✔ tibble  3.1.8     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9\n✔ tidyr   1.2.0     ✔ stringr 1.5.0\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.2\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    last_plot\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n\n    layout\n\n\n\n#load the data\nfight_songs <-read_csv(\"data/fight-songs.csv\")\n\nRows: 65 Columns: 23\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (19): school, conference, song_name, writers, year, student_writer, offi...\ndbl  (4): bpm, sec_duration, number_fights, trope_count\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe original graph includes intersecting lines with the average bpm and duration, so I took the mean of each column to determine those exact values so I could include them in my recreation.\n\nfight_songs %>% pull(bpm) %>% mean()\n\n[1] 128.8\n\nfight_songs %>% pull(sec_duration) %>% mean()\n\n[1] 71.90769\n\n\nNow to the graphing. I decided to create this graph in ggplot first and then make it interactive using the ggplotly() function from plotly.\n\ngraph <- fight_songs %>% \n  #color code each point by school name and include number of tropes\n  ggplot(aes(x=sec_duration, y=bpm, color=school, text=trope_count)) +\n  #make a scatter plot\n  geom_point() + \n  #include the average lines using the means I calculated above.\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 71.90769) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 128.8) + \n  #omit the legend \n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") + \n  #match the quadrant labels \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 40, y = 65, label = \"Slow but short\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 45, y = 180, label = \"Fast and short\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 135, y = 180, label = \"Fast but long\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 135, y = 65, label = \"Slow and long\") + \n  #match the axes labels\n  labs(x=\"Duration\", y=\"Beats per Minute\") \n\n\nggplotly(graph)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were two main things I struggled with in this recreation. I searched and searched for some “university color palette for R” but came up empty. The only options I was left with were using default ggplot colors or making my own using hex codes for each school. I decided that I would use default colors to save myself some sanity (and each school has its own color, just not its school color). I also could not figure out how to include a separate chart of sorts for the number of tropes in each song; after some searching, I found that the aes(text= ) in ggplot() mapping could be used to display the trope number in the hover menu after converting using ggplotly(). You can see in the final that Georgia does indeed have 1 fight song cliche in my recreation (the number at the bottom of the hover menu).\nI played around with ggvis for a few hours on my first attempt and, while I found it interesting with cool outputs, I had a hard time figuring out how to add all the elements that I needed to recreate this graph. Upon reading, I learned that ggvis is a sort of work-in-progress, and everything in ggplot does not have a direct translation to ggvis. I think ggvis could be used to make some really cool visualizations, but I was unsuccessful in using it for this exercise."
